 **"Can we run 7B models on a phone?"**
 I implemented a Quaternion-BitNet model that uses **1/4 parameters** and **1.58-bit quantization**.

 ## Result
 * **Loss:** 1.5027 (Shakespeare dataset)
 * **H/W:** NVIDIA A100 (Single GPU)

 -> Look at the distinct -1, 0, 1 peaks! The quantization works perfectly.
